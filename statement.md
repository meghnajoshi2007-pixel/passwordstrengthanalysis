## **Problem Statement**

Password security is a major concern in the digital world, as users often create weak or easily predictable passwords. Weak passwords increase the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyberattacks. Many users are not aware of the strength of their passwords or how to improve them. This project aims to analyze the strength of user-entered passwords and provide feedback to help users create more secure credentials.

## **Scope of the Project**

This project focuses on developing a simple and interactive Password Strength Analyzer that evaluates passwords based on various parameters such as length, use of special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numerical digits. The project will not include advanced cryptographic analysis or real-time breach detection but will serve as an educational and practical tool for improving password habits.

## **Target Users**

* Students learning basic programming and cybersecurity concepts.
* General users who want to check the strength of their passwords.
* Beginners exploring how authentication-related tools work.
* Educators demonstrating password security principles.

## **High-Level Features**

* Accept user input and analyze password strength.
* Evaluate length, character variety, and complexity.
* Provide a score or category (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong).
* Display suggestions to improve password strength.
* Simple interface suitable for beginners and educational use.
